Okay so for the encapsulations, that was making the definitions with all the parameters in that we used. Since encapsulation is wrapping a piece of code in a function. 

Next up is generalization. I don't know specifically what we did that counts as that, but I guess since we made it so that the size and placement of the Functions can be moved and their size altered. 

So for the process of making the scene, we made our functions that was encapsulation. With the Function definitions having the code in it  counts as encapsulation which makes it a hell of a lot easier to access. It would have been a lot more work to make the scene without making the encapsulations

As for the generalizations, I didn't realize that was what we were doing by adding the variables into the parameters of the definition  of the functions.

What we end up using are the encapsulations, by calling those functions, and we used the generalizations that we built into the code to be able to move them around the scene.
